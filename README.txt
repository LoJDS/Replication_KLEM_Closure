###Calibration Sheet
Takes an IO table and elasticities as input and calibrates CES coefficients accordingly

###Simulation Sheet

1. Click "Initial Values" to get to calibration point

2. Copy-paste closure-specific cells 

3. Set target (0-100%) and click "Solve"

4. Generate full profile for a given closure by clicking "Profile" AFTER clicking "Starting value" and copy-pasting closure cells

###Results
Outcome of simulations are reported here

###Closure-specific result sheets
Copy-paste from Result Sheet to Closure-specific sheets

###Diagnostic Indicators
